--- Hydrax-0.5.4 --------------------------------
* Added Microsoft VS2010 project (NaÃ«m Baron).
* Fixed some GLSL shaders.
* Fixed CG/HLSL shaders (not tested in previous version).
--- Hydrax-0.5.3 --------------------------------
* Now Hydrax supports OGRE 1.7.X "our of the box" (not tested).
* Global transparency add water colour to the objects viewed trought the free surface.
* Created new noise called "Real". At now, "Real" is composed by...
 - Perlin noise (same released in previous versions of Hydrax)
 - Sea waves (That must be added at code, 3 is sufficient to most cases).
 - Pressure points (IDEM)
* Now, underwater scattering increases with distance, not only with depth.
 - If the point viewed is at the other side of the free surface, scattering effect
   is limited to water environment.
* HLSL/CG shaders have been traslated to use all new functionality (not tested).

--- Hydrax-0.5.2 --------------------------------
* Added GLSL shaders support.
